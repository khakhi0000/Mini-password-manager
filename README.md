This is my little corner for Python practice and fun projects.
You'll find small programs that cover lists, loops, functions, and cool tricks.
All projects are beginner-friendly, so anyone can jump in and learn along.
I like to experiment, break things, and fix them — just like a mini Python lab!
Feel free to check it out, try the code, and maybe even suggest improvements!
